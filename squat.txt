Here’s the start of a program for a weight training app that coaches users on how much weight they should lift for each of these three lifts: squat, bench, and deadlift. The program begins by having the user lift only 10 pounds for each lift. Each time they complete a set for a particular lift and say they are ready for the next set, add 10 pounds to the weight of their previous set and print a message that this is the new weight they should lift. The sets are all done for one lift at a time. So, for example, a user might squat 10 pounds, then 20 pounds, then 30 pounds and then say they don’t want to keep doing that lift. In this case, they’ll now get a printed message to bench 10 pounds, and so on and so forth.
